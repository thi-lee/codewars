# CODEWARS KATA
as of Jun 26, 2020

In this repository, you will find code challenges from Codewars that I have worked on. </br>
I have included instructions of each, my solution, best-practice and clever solution from </br>
`codewars.com`, and a brief discussion of what I can learn from that solution.
