# my solution:
def high_and_low(numbers):
    num = numbers.split()
    lst = []
    num = list(map(int, num))
    lst.append(sorted(num, reverse=True)[0])
    lst.append(sorted(num, reverse=True)[-1])
    return ' '.join(list(map(str, lst)))

# best practices

def high_and_low(numbers):
    nn = [int(s) for s in numbers.split(' ')]
    return "%i %i" % (max(nn), min(nn))

What I learned/noticed from this solution:
* list comprehension is powerful â€“ yet I still have a hard time
implementing it
* the use of f-string comes in handy for the best-practice solution,
while mine has to go throgh several steps (convert elements of a list
from string to integer and join them)
